    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I&rsquo;m Nolan &mdash; a developer, researcher, and systems thinker with
      a deep love for elegant infrastructure, expressive code, and language as a
      fragile, imperfect vehicle for meaning.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      My background is in both Computer Science and Hispanic Linguistics, which
      means I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time thinking about how systems operate
      &mdash; whether they&rsquo;re codebases, human languages, or collaborative
      teams. That dual perspective shapes everything I build: from data
      validation pipelines to language-aware learning tools.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I care deeply about systems that hold up over time: infrastructure
      that&rsquo;s transparent, tools that teach, and software that makes life
      more understandable rather than more confusing. I&rsquo;ve worked on
      scalable backend platforms, research automation tools, developer education
      systems, and more &mdash; but my favorite projects are the ones where
      design and reasoning intersect.
    </p>

      <li class="ml-4 sm:ml-0">Architecture that&rsquo;s clear, not clever</li>
      <li class="ml-4 sm:ml-0">Code that teaches, not just executes</li>
      <li class="ml-4 sm:ml-0">
        Collaboration grounded in empathy and intellectual honesty
      </li>
      <li class="ml-4 sm:ml-0">
        Intentional use of technology &mdash; especially in the era of
        generative AI
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic about GenAI. I see real potential, but I
      also believe deeply in human-centered design, explainability, and systems
      that respect the limits of language. Having studied linguistics, I know
      how often words obscure as much as they clarify &mdash; and that
      perspective keeps me grounded as an engineer.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Outside the Code</h2>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      When I&rsquo;m not building things, you might find me interpreting for
      Spanish-speaking patients, designing puzzles, running an escape room
      nonprofit, or chasing obscure ideas about cognition and meaning.
      I&rsquo;ve always believed the best work comes from unexpected
      intersections.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
      If you&rsquo;re thinking about how to build thoughtful systems, design
      better tools, or create community around meaningful work &mdash; I&rsquo;d
      love to talk.
