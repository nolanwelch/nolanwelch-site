      hallMonitor 2.0 is a data validation and quality assurance system
      developed for the Neural Dynamics of Control Lab. It ensures that datasets
      across multiple studies remain consistent with tracker files, metadata
      standards, and protocol-specific rules.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      In research environments, silent errors accumulate quietly but cost
      dearly. This project is about making invisible problems visible early
      &mdash; and doing so in a way that respects modularity, transparency, and
      auditability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Challenges</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Rewriting the system from Bash to Python meant rethinking abstractions,
      error handling, logging, and validation structure. It had to scale to
      multiple data types and still provide clear, actionable feedback for
      research assistants and analysts.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Reflections</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      hallMonitor taught me how to build systems that last &mdash; and how to
      balance flexibility with reliability. It also deepened my commitment to
      writing code that explains itself, even as it scales.
