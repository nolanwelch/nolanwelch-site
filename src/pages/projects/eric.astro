        class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline"

        rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapel Thrill Escapes</a
      >, a student-run nonprofit escape room. It manages event scheduling, staff
      coordination, volunteer onboarding, and performance tracking. ERIC also
      interfaces with the Bookeo API to check for new, unchecked bookings and
      identifies participants registered as "on-campus students." If a
      participant does not provide a valid on-campus student ID, their booking
      is automatically cancelled. The system runs on a loop via an Amazon EC2
      instance to ensure consistent enforcement.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Student organizations deserve tooling that&rsquo;s as thoughtful as any
      production system. ERIC was built to make behind-the-scenes operations
      intuitive, reliable, and maintainable by future student teams.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Challenges</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Working within a nonprofit context meant designing for change, simplicity,
      and low overhead. ERIC needed to feel friendly to non-engineers while
      still solving real logistical pain points.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Reflections</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      This project solidified my interest in systems architecture as community
      infrastructure. It&rsquo;s where technical clarity meets operational
      compassion.
