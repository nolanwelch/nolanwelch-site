      This project is still evolving &mdash; but it reflects some of the ideas I
      care most deeply about in software, education, and community design.

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Swimmingly is a gamified learning platform designed to teach real-world
      debugging and software reasoning through fictional workplace challenges.
      It blends narrative context with technical tasks to create an immersive
      environment where learners don't just write code &mdash; they solve
      problems like engineers do.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      I believe debugging is one of the most undervalued paths to deeper
      software fluency. Swimmingly flips the typical learning flow by starting
      not with blank files, but with imperfect, human code. Learners step into a
      systems-thinking mindset from day one.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Challenges</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Designing scalable infrastructure for persona-driven feedback, integrating
      Git-based workflows, and building meaningful progression paths without
      artificial gamification posed interesting design constraints &mdash; and
      informed many of the platform&rsquo;s most unique features.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Reflections</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Swimmingly has become a vehicle for exploring my broader philosophy: that
      software education should focus on reasoning, not rote syntax; mentorship,
      not metrics. It&rsquo;s also been an exciting proving ground for
      lightweight backend systems and thoughtful architecture.
