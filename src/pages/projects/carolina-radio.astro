      Carolina Radio turns Spotify sessions into a shared radio experience with
      friends. The app allows everyone to add song requests to a communal pool,
      and tracks are selected dynamically based on request popularity, recency,
      and a touch of randomness &mdash; creating a synchronized, social playlist
      that makes it feel like you're all in the same room, wherever you are.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Inspiration</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      The radio has long been a way to discover music communally &mdash;
      especially student radio stations like WXYC. Carolina Radio expands on
      that tradition, democratizing the music suggestion process and reimagining
      social listening for the digital age.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">What It Does</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      The app collects song submissions from users across campus and builds a
      dynamic, evolving queue. Songs are chosen based on a combination of how
      often they've been requested, how long they've been waiting, and how
      recently they've played &mdash; creating a shared listening rhythm that
      feels organic and alive.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Technical Overview</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      The frontend is built with React and hosted on Cloudflare Pages for
      low-latency, global distribution. The backend uses Python and FastAPI,
      with MongoDB Atlas for managing song metadata and user sessions. Spotify
      API integration is handled entirely through the backend, making it
      lightweight for end users.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Reflections</h2>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
      Carolina Radio is more than a playlist tool &mdash; it's an experiment in
      designing participatory systems where music discovery, connection, and
      rhythm emerge organically from community input. It's one of my favorite
      examples of systems design with a social soul.
